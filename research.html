    <h4>Big Data Platform for Chinese National Table Tennis Team</h4>
    <h5>2018 -- ongoing</h5>
    <p>
        Chinese National Table Tennis Team (CTTT) seeks to improve players’ performance with big data.
        I have designed and developed the Big Data Platform of CTTT to provide the team with efficient and effective data service for many major Table Tennis events, such as Table Tennis in Tokyo 2021.
        I now serve as the chief architect of the platform.
        The platform is built upon my three important research works as follows.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Data Acquisition</strong><br>
            The platform needs to process massive amounts of broadcast video data to extract meaningful, detailed information.
            Thus, I developed a novel interactive user interface for efficiently acquiring data.
            The work has been accepted by ACM SIGCHI 2021.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Data Mining</strong><br>
            Based on the massive data, domain experts expect to gain data insights into players’ playing styles or tactics.
            Thus, I proposed several multivariate pattern mining algorithms to discover patterns.
            Two of them are publicly available on OSF and accepted by IEEE VIS 2020 and 2021.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Visual Analytics</strong><br>
            Domain experts, such as coaches, would usually find it difficult to understand complex pattern mining results without intuitive visual designs.
            Thus, I proposed tailored visual analytics systems with intuitive user interactions, such as natural language commands.
            These systems have been highly recognized by domain experts for their usefulness and effectiveness.
            These applications resulted in three first-author papers accepted by IEEE VIS, and a second-author papers published in IEEE TVCG.
