        <h5>Abstract</h5>
        <p>
            In this work, we propose a generic visual analytics framework to
            support tactic analysis based on data collected from racquet sports
            (such as tennis and badminton). The proposed approach models each
            rally in a game as a sequence of hits (i.e., events) until one athlete
            scores a point. Each hit can be described with a set of attributes, such
            as the positions of the ball and the techniques used to hit the ball
            (such as drive and volley in tennis). Thus, the mentioned sequence of
            hits can be viewed as a multivariate event sequence. By detecting and
            analyzing the multivariate subsequences that frequently occur in the
            rallies (namely, tactical patterns), athletes can gain insights into the
            playing styles adopted by their opponents, and therefore help them
            identify systematic weaknesses of the opponents and develop counter
            strategies in matches. To support such analysis effectively, we
            propose a steerable multivariate sequential pattern mining algorithm
            with adjustable weights over event attributes, such that the domain
            expert can obtain frequent tactical patterns according to the attributes
            specified by himself. We also propose a re-configurable glyph design
            to help users simultaneously analyze multiple attributes of the hits.
            The framework further supports comparative analysis of the tactical
            patterns, e.g., for different athletes or the same athlete playing under
            different conditions. By applying the framework on two datasets
            collected in tennis and badminton matches, we demonstrate that
            the system is generic and effective for tactic analysis in sports and
            can help identify signature techniques used by individual athletes.
            Finally, we discuss the strengths and limitations of the proposed
            approach based on the feedback from the domain experts.
