                The reason to make this project, is that we need a system to manage several systems and more and more
                data of table tennis matches. In the previous work, we developed a system, which can collect data in
                table tennis matches efficiently and accurately, and several systems, which can analyze the data from
                multiple angles. However, we hadn't integrated these tools and organized so much data effectively. At
                last, we decided to develop a platform, in which users can use tools and observe the data according
                to their authority.

                Department of Physical Education, Zhejiang University</i> and <i>ZJUIDG</i>. In the cooperation, <i>
                Dept. of P.E. in ZJU</i> provides theoretical support. They guide the way how to analyze and which
                types of data to collect. Our group(ZJUIDG) provides technical support, including developing systems,
                establishing a database and so on. All these works serves <i>CTTA</i>.
